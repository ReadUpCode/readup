# Read Up

## Find the best articles on code.

We’re constantly getting great technical articles sent to us from developer friends. Via e-mail. Read Up stops the madness and aggregates them so we can all find the best stuff and Read Up on a given topic. Stack Overflow is magical for specific questions. Google is great for finding docs. But neither is great for finding those hidden blog post gems or great tutorials. Read Up fills that gap.

Read Up is built by developers, for developers. It’s open source, and we welcome contributions to improve the site.


#### Technology:
   Read Up is deployed on AWS, using EC2 for the server, RDS for MySQL cloud hosting, and S3 handles static image file hosting.

- SQL - While not the typical choice for a node app, it was clear that with all the relationships among our data, SQL was our best bet. We use Sequelize as our ORM.
- Node/Express - The advantages of single language app development and asynchronous I/O helped win the day for node. 
- AngularJS -  Two-way data binding.
- Stylus - The variables, mixins, and import abilities let us write clean, responsive and modular CSS that was easy to iterate on.
- Browserify - Modularized code is clean code, and Browserify brings that to the front end by mimicking node’s require syntax. 
- Grunt - With only a 2.5 week development sprint, Grunt saved us precious time by automating our compilation, build and watch tasks.
